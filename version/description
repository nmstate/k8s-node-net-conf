Update NodeNeworkState desiredState only on changes

Before this release it was updateing desiredState at the same time that we refresh
currentState leaving to connectivity issues. Now currentState is update at different
controller to refresh it so desiredState is only applyed if it's really changed.


```
docker pull HANDLER_IMAGE
```
