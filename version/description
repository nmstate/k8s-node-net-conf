Increase resilience and force vlan_filtering at bridge

The NetworkManager < 1.20 present some race conditions that end with
nmstatectl set with transitory failures, they can be overcome by some
retry + sleep mechanism implemented in this release.

A rollback mechanism has being implemented to go back to previous network
configuration in case of error at running the vlan-filtering script or pinging
default gw.

The vlan-filtering script was not setting the pvid untagged flag at the bridge
itself.

```
docker pull HANDLER_IMAGE
```
