# 102: First Policy and Enactments

TODO:
- configuration via policies
- define what is the desired state
- the desired state will be configured on the host via NM
- example of ethernet iface
- wait for condition available
- show all conditions and explain them
- show NNS that it is there
- there is one extra object I skipped, enactment
- since policy may match multiple nodes, enactment is per node
- list enactments to see status per each node
- let's try to apply invalid config (wrong nic name)
- show the policy degraded, show that enactment is degraded and status shows why
